# Task 1: Software configuration

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

Hello, my name is Lidia. I am from Ukraine, but now I live in Poland.  
My country is currently going through terrible times, but we are a strong 
nation, so we will overcome everything. Everything will be Ukraine!

In order to change the world, you must first change yourself. 
Therefore, participation in the QA Challenge project is like a breath 
of fresh air for me. Learning is never easy, but persistence is 
always rewarded with the achievement of a certain goal.:sweat_smile: In my 
case, it is a change of work and development in a new field of IT for 
me. After the challenge, I want to be proud of myself and my 
successes! :muscle:

### Good luck!
